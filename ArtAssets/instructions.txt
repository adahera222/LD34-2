Welcome Time Traveler!

For thousands of years people have be jumping in and out of the time stream, winning the lottery, changing history and creating paradoxes, but the time steam can’t be diverted much further. If something isn’t done now the whole thing will collapse into a big puddle of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey at the bottom of a worm hole!

That’s where you come in! 

You only get one chance to put things right. In order to win, you need to fix 10 points worth of important historical events before the wormhole divertor known as the tile pile runs out, but watch out, other time travelers will try to steal your glory!

Laid out before you is all of time and space, but you can’t access it all the time or from the same point. On the table should be a map of what is currently available. Important events, marked by dates are scattered across the map. Sadly the time stream is broken in many places or branched incorrectly. Only connected time streams can be traveled through. 

On the left there is a card listing three events in time, each allocated a number of points that can be won by repairing the event. Once any one of these events has been repaired the goal card will go to the bottom of the deck and new goals revealed, so get there fast. 

There will also be a face up tile, this is the next available piece of time stream. On your turn you must use this tile to change the map. Click on one of the arrows surrounding the map in order to slide the tiles in that row or column in the direction indicated. The end tile will return to the bottom of the tile deck and your shiny new one will slide in next to the arrow you chose. 

You can now move anywhere on the connected time stream. To repair an event simply land on it during your turn.
